I had called upon I friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas , with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season . him was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown , a pipe-rack within him reach upon the right , and a pile of crumpled morning papers , evidently newly studied , near at hand .['Beside', 'the', 'couch', 'was', 'a', 'wooden', 'chair', ',', 'and', 'on', 'the', 'angle', 'of', 'the', 'back', 'hung', 'a', 'very', 'seedy', 'and', 'disreputable', 'hard-felt', 'hat', ',', 'much', 'the', 'worse', 'for', 'wear', ',', 'and', 'cracked', 'in', 'several', 'places', '.']A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of a wooden chair suggested that a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination .`` him are engaged , '' said I ; `` perhaps I interrupt him . ''['``', 'Not', 'at', 'all', '.'] I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss I results .The matter is a perfectly trivial one '' -- I jerked I thumb in the direction of a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places -- `` but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction . '' I seated I in I armchair and warmed I hands before I crackling fire , for a sharp frost had set in , and the windows were thick with the ice crystals .`` I suppose , '' I remarked , `` that , homely as it looks , this thing has some deadly story linked on to this thing -- that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime .

''`` It is Peterson , the commissionaire hat . ''`` No , no , Peterson , the commissionaire found It . It owner is unknown . I beg that you will look upon It not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem .And , first , as to how It came here . It arrived upon Christmas morning , in company with a good fat goose , which is , I have no doubt , roasting at this moment in front of Peterson 's fire .The facts are these : about four o'clock on Christmas morning , Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , was returning from some small jollification and was making Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , way homeward down Tottenham Court Road .In front of Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , saw , in the gaslight , a tallish man , walking with a slight stagger , and carrying a white goose slung over Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , shoulder .As Peterson , who , as you know , is a very honest fellow , reached the corner of Goodge Street , a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of The roughs .One of the latter knocked off a tallish man hat , on which a tallish man raised a tallish man stick to defend a tallish man and , swinging his stick over a tallish man head , smashed the shop window behind a tallish man .Peterson had rushed forward to protect this stranger from Peterson , the commissionaire assailants ; but a tallish man man , the commissionaire , dropped Peterson , the commissionaire white goose slung over his shoulder , took to Peterson , the commissionaire heels , and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road .The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson , so that Peterson , the commissionaire was left in possession of the field of battle , and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose . ''`` Which surely Peterson , the commissionaire restored to surely he owner ? ''`` Peterson , the commissionaire dear fellow , there lies the problem .It is true that ` For Mrs. Henry Baker ' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird 's left leg , and it is also true that the initials ` H. B. ' are legible upon the lining of a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places , but as there are some thousands of Bakers , and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours , it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them . ''['``', 'What', ',', 'then', ',', 'did', 'Peterson', 'do', '?', "''"]`` Peterson , the commissionaire brought round both hat and goose to Peterson , the commissionaire on Christmas morning , knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to Peterson , the commissionaire . a white goose slung over his shoulder we retained until this morning , when there were signs that , in spite of the slight frost , it would be well that a white goose slung over his shoulder should be eaten without unnecessary delay . a white goose slung over his shoulder finder has carried Its finder off , therefore , to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose , while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost Peterson , the commissionaire Christmas dinner .

''`` Here is the man lens .You know the man methods .What can you gather you as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article ? '' the man took the tattered object in the man hands and turned the tattered object over rather ruefully . the tattered object was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape , hard and much the worse for wear .['The', 'lining', 'had', 'been', 'of', 'red', 'silk', ',', 'but', 'was', 'a', 'good', 'deal', 'discoloured', '.']['There', 'was', 'no', 'maker', "'s", 'name', ';', 'but', ',', 'as', 'Holmes', 'had', 'remarked', ',', 'the', 'initials', '``', 'H.', 'B.', "''", 'were', 'scrawled', 'upon', 'one', 'side', '.'] one side was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer , but the elastic was missing .For the rest , it was cracked , exceedingly dusty , and spotted in several places , although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing the discoloured patches with ink .`` the man can see nothing , '' said the man , handing it back to the man friend .`` On the contrary , Watson , Watson can see everything .You fail , however , to reason from what You see . You are too timid in drawing You inferences . ''`` Then , pray tell the man what it is that You can infer from a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places ? '' the man picked a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places up and gazed at a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of the man .`` It is perhaps less suggestive than a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places might have been , '' the man remarked , `` and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct , and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability .That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it , and also that the man was fairly well-to-do within the last three years , although the man has now fallen upon evil days . the man had foresight , but has less now than formerly , pointing to a moral retrogression , which , when taken with the decline of the man fortunes , seems to indicate some evil influence , probably drink , at work upon the man .This may account also for the obvious fact that the man wife has ceased to love the man . ''['``', 'My', 'dear', 'Holmes', '!', "''"]`` the man has , however , retained some degree of self-respect , '' the man continued , disregarding the man remonstrance .`` the man is a man who leads a sedentary life , goes out little , is out of training entirely , is middle-aged , has grizzled hair which the man has had cut within the last few days , and which the man anoints with lime-cream .These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from the man very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places .Also , by the way , that it is extremely improbable that the man has gas laid on in the man house . ''['``', 'You', 'are', 'certainly', 'joking', ',', 'Holmes', '.', "''"]['``', 'Not', 'in', 'the', 'least', '.']Is it possible that even now , when the man give You these results , You are unable to see how these results are attained ? ''`` the man have no doubt that the man am very stupid , but the man must confess that the man am unable to follow You .For example , how did You deduce that the man was intellectual ? ''For answer Holmes clapped a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places upon the man head . a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of the man nose .`` a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places is a question of cubic capacity , '' said the man ; `` a man with so large a brain must have something in a man with so large a brain .

''['``', 'Your', 'reasoning', 'is', 'certainly', 'plausible', '.', "''"]`` The further points , that the man is middle-aged , that the man hair is grizzled , that his hair has been recently cut , and that the man uses lime-cream , are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining . A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair discloses a large number of hair-ends , clean cut by the scissors of the barber .['They', 'all', 'appear', 'to', 'be', 'adhesive', ',', 'and', 'there', 'is', 'a', 'distinct', 'odour', 'of', 'lime-cream', '.']This dust , Your will observe , is not the gritty , grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of his house , showing that his house has been hung up indoors most of the time , while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely , and could therefore , hardly be in the best of training . ''`` But the man wife -- Your said that his wife -- you had ceased to love the man . ''`` a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places has not been brushed for weeks .When Your see Your , Your dear Watson , with a week 's accumulation of dust upon Your very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat , much the worse for wear , and cracked in several places , and when Your wife -- you allows you to go out in such a state , Your shall fear that Your also have been unfortunate enough to lose Your wife -- you affection . ''`` But the man might be a bachelor . ''`` Nay , the man was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to the man wife -- you .Remember the card upon the bird 's leg . ''['``', 'You', 'have', 'an', 'answer', 'to', 'everything', '.']But how on earth do Your deduce that the gas is not laid on in the man house ? ''`` One tallow stain , or even two , might come by chance ; but when Your see no less than five , Your think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow -- walks upstairs at night probably with the man hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other .Anyhow , the man never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet .Are Your satisfied ? ''`` Well , it is very ingenious , '' said Your , laughing ; `` but since , as Your said just now , there has been no crime committed , and no harm done save the loss of The goose , sir !

''Sherlock Holmes had opened Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief mouth to reply , when the door flew open , and Peterson , the commissionaire , rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment .`` The goose , sir !
